=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
// WARNING: If you’re deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

This Quick Start was built using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and is deployed via a synthesized template.

The deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose the following option to launch the AWS CloudFormation template.

[start=2]
. Check the AWS Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-short-name} is built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. 

[start=3]
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them if needed. For details on each parameter, see the section below. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
. On the *Configure stack options* page, you can https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html[specify tags^] (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html[set advanced options^]. When you’re finished, choose *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, review and confirm the template settings. Under *Capabilities*, select the two check boxes to acknowledge that the template creates IAM resources and might require the ability to automatically expand macros.
. Choose *Create stack* to deploy the stack.

This allows you to get started quickly with a fully functional dashboard. Note that this example dashboard is created specifically for the users of the Rigado Alegro Kit. If you are not using Rigado devices you will need to create you own dataset, analysis and dashboard based on the devices you use. The ETL process and Glue Crawler that ingest the data from the IoT Broker to make them available in Amazon QuickSight are data-model agnostic so you just need to link the created AWS Glue table as a datasource in Amazon QuickSight
