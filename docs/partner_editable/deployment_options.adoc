This Quick Start deploys a continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment (CICD) pipeline using AWS CodePipeline. 

If you prefer not to sign up with Amazon QuickSight, you can exclude the QuickSight dashboard from the deployment by omitting the QuickSight ADMIN user name on the AWS CloudFormation template.
