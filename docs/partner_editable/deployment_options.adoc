This Quick Start deploys a CICD Pipeline using AWS Code Pipeline. You can choose to exclude the Amazon QiuckSight dashboard from the deployment if you prefer to avoid signing up. To do so, you simply can omit the QuickSight ADMIN username as input from the AWS CloudFormation template. This will exclude the deployment action for Amazon QuickSight.
