image::../images/iot-quickstart-archtecture.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A REST serverless microservice to onboard devices and gateways by serial number. The service creates the AWS IoT Core resources to securely connect to AWS MQTT Broker.
* An IoT Datalake ingesting the data from the long term storage and analytics.
* An example AWS Quicksight Dahsboard to display data form the datalake (Compatible devices only).
* An example IoT Device real-time Monitoring dahsboard using AWS IoT SiteWise (Compatible devices Only).
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
//TODO: extend the bullet points to include all the details in the arch diag
// [.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
