As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

//TODO: expand on all the points below

For the device onboarding:
* IoT Certificate & MQTT Endpoint : 
* API Gateway : 
* Cognito :
* Lambda Function : 
* Endpoints : 
* Bucket : 
* Dynamo : 

Then in the.....
* IoT MQTT protocol :
* AWS IoT Core :
** IoT rule :
** IoT topic :
* IoT Events : 
* Dynamo DB : 
* Datalake consisting of:
** Kenisis : 
** S3 : 
** Glue : 
** Athena : 
** Quicksight :

* A REST serverless microservice to onboard devices and gateways by serial number. The service creates the AWS IoT Core resources to securely connect to AWS MQTT Broker.
* An IoT Datalake ingesting the data from the long term storage and analytics.
* An example AWS Quicksight Dahsboard to display data form the datalake (Compatible devices only).
* An example IoT Device real-time Monitoring dahsboard using AWS IoT SiteWise (Compatible devices Only).
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
//TODO: extend the bullet points to include all the details in the arch diag
// [.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
